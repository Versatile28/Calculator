### What I learned

In this project, I've learned how to create a basic calculator using only HTML and CSS. I structured the calculator layout with HTML, organizing buttons and the display for clear functionality. Using CSS, I styled the interface to make it visually appealing and ensured the layout was responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes. I also added hover effects to the buttons for a more interactive user experience.
